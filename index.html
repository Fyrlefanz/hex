  <p>Welcome to the Ledger FreeClaiming Guide</p>

<p>To claim using a Ledger you will need Electrum. Electrum is needed to sign messages. Remember: you will not be exporting/exposing your privat keys. They will stay on your ledger and there is no chance to get compromised. You can download Electrum here: https://electrum.org/#download</p>

<p>Once downloaded, start Electrum. You will be greeted with the following screen:</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum1</p>

<p>On the next screen, choose Standard Wallet and press next.</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum2</p>

<p>Make sure your Ledger is connected to your PC. Your Ledger needs to be unlocked and you need to have the Bitcoin App open on your Ledger Device. Then choose the bottom option: Use a hardware device and press next.</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum3</p>

<p>After a few seconds Electrum should detect your Ledger. Press next.</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum4</p>

<p>Now we have to choose the type of addresses in your wallet. If your addresses start with a &quot;1&quot; -> choose legacy (p2pkh) If your addresses start with a &quot;3&quot; -> choose p2sh-segit (p2wpkh-p2sh) If your addresses start with &quot;bc1&quot; -> choose native segwit (p2wpkh)</p>

<p>Don't change anything in the derivation path. Click next.</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum5</p>

<p>On the file encryption window, just press next.</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum6</p>

<p>After a few seconds you should get to the main Electrum window. Go to the top and click on &quot;View&quot; -> click on &quot;Show Addresses&quot;.</p>

<p>IMG: Electrum7</p>

<p>This should give you a new tab next to &quot;Receive&quot; called &quot;Addresses&quot;. Click on that. Now you should see all of the Bitcoin Addresses your Ledger uses. You can see the balances of each address and the number of transactions (Tx) on the right side</p>

<p>IMG Electrum8</p>

<p>We have to claim each address with a balance 1-by-1. Choose the top address with a balance and rightclick it (doublefingerclick on MacOS) and choose &quot;Copy Address&quot;</p>

<p>IMG Electrum9</p>

<p>Now go to the HEX Website using this link (You will get 10% more HEX using our link): https://go.hex.win/?r=0xUnsereAddresse</p>

<p>Make sure to log into MetaMask and allow MetaMask to connect to the Website.</p>

<p>Then click on the &quot;Claim&quot; tab in the top. Paste your address into the field and press on the &quot;Claim This Address&quot; button</p>

<p>IMG Go_HEX1</p>

<p>You will see a message that looks like this: Claim_HEX_to_YourETHAddress Copy this message by clicking on the circled icon.</p>

<p>IMG Go_HEX2</p>

<p>Then go back to Electrum. Rightclick on your address and choose &quot;Sign/verify message&quot;</p>

<p>IMG Electrum10</p>

<p>Paste your copied message into the top field called &quot;Message&quot; Make sure your Ledger is still connected, logged in and that you have the Bitcoin App open on the device. Then press on the &quot;Sign&quot; button in the bottom left.</p>

<p>IMG Electrum11</p>

<p>After a few seconds a Message hash should appear. Check if the Message hash matches the one shown on your Ledger Device. If it matches, confirm the signing proccess on your Ledger.</p>

<p>IMG Electrum12</p>

<p>Now you should see a signature in the &quot;Signature&quot; field. Copy the complete signature.</p>

<p>IMG Electrum13</p>

<p>Go back to the website and paste your signature into the &quot;Signature&quot; field.</p>

<p>IMG Go_HEX3</p>

<p>Now you can choose the number of days you want to stake. For FreeClaims the minimum number of days is 350. Maximum stake length is 5555 days. To get maximum bonuses you have to choose a stakelength of 3641 days or more. Once you have chosen your stakelength click on the &quot;Submit Claim&quot; button. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask and wait for it to confirm. Congratulations, you have successfully FreeClaimed HEX.</p>

<p>If you have multiple addresses with a balance go back to step 8 and repeat the proccess for the other addresses. If you have any further questions, or are stuck somewhere pm me on Telegram @Earlofcockwood</p>
